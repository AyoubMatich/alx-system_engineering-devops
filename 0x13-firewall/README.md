`ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a front-end for managing firewall rules in Linux. It provides a simplified interface for configuring the `iptables` firewall, which is the default firewall configuration tool in many Linux distributions. `ufw` is designed to make it easier for users to manage firewall rules without needing to understand the complexities of `iptables`.
